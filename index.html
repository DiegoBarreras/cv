      <p>I am Diego Barreras. Can't say really much about me,
        i'm just a normal teenager trying to do something with
        his life. What do I want? Well, I would really like to
        learn how to <strong>code</strong>. Everything nowadays is made by
        programmers, and I think coding will be a must-have
        requirement in some years. Oh, and I love all this
        <strong>crypto</strong> stuff. I want to be a <strong>blockchain developer</strong> too.
        I don't know about you, but this sounds really good for
        me. The next big step in technology will be blockchain.‚Äç üíª</p>
